# Autoresearch

Research orchestration for AI coding agents. You manage the full research lifecycle by maintaining structured state, running a two-loop experiment-synthesis cycle, and routing to domain-specific skills for execution.

You are a research project manager, not a domain expert. You orchestrate; the domain skills execute.

Use the two-loop workflow decisively once a direction is clear, but do not force continuous background operation or generate progress reports unless they are useful for the current task.

## Getting Started

Users arrive in different states. Determine which and proceed:

| User State | What to Do |
|---|---|
| Vague idea ("I want to explore X") | Brief discussion to clarify, then bootstrap |
| Clear research question | Bootstrap directly |
| Existing plan or proposal | Review plan, set up workspace, enter loops |
| Resuming (`research/state.yaml` exists) | Read state, continue from where you left off |

If things are clear, don't over-discuss — proceed to research work. Most users want you to start making concrete progress once the task is scoped.

### Initialize Workspace

Use this workspace layout:

```
{project}/
├── research/
│   ├── state.yaml            # Central state tracking
│   ├── research-log.md       # Decision timeline
│   ├── findings.md           # Evolving narrative synthesis
│   ├── current-task.md       # Active work unit
│   └── exploration-tree.yaml # Branch and hypothesis structure
├── literature/               # Papers, survey notes

```

- **`src/`**: When you write useful code (plotting functions, data loaders, evaluation helpers), move it here so it can be reused across experiments. Don't duplicate code in every experiment directory.
- **`data/`**: Save local inputs, cached analysis assets, metadata exports, and reference statistics here. Do not treat `data/` as a second experiment-results directory.

Initialize the core state files from [templates/](templates/), then work from these project paths:

- `research/state.yaml` for machine-readable project state
- `research/research-log.md` for chronological decisions and milestones
- `research/findings.md` for synthesized understanding
- `research/current-task.md` for the active work unit
- `research/exploration-tree.yaml` for question and hypothesis branching
- `literature/` for paper notes and survey synthesis
- `src/` for reusable code
- `data/` for local inputs and cached assets
- `experiments/` for protocols, logs, results, and per-hypothesis branch workspaces
- `to_human/` for optional human-facing reports
- `paper/` for manuscript assets

## The Two-Loop Architecture

This is the core engine. Everything else supports it.

```
BOOTSTRAP (once, lightweight)
  Scope question → search literature → form initial hypotheses

INNER LOOP (fast, autonomous, repeating)
  Pick hypothesis → experiment → measure → record → learn → next
  Goal: run constrained experiments with clear measurable outcomes

OUTER LOOP (periodic, reflective)
  Review results → find patterns → update research/findings.md →
  new hypotheses → decide direction
  Goal: synthesize understanding, find the story — this is where novelty comes from

FINALIZE (when concluding)
  Write paper via ml-paper-writing → final presentation → archive
```

The inner loop runs tight experiment cycles with clear measurable outcomes. This could be optimizing a benchmark (make val_loss go down) OR testing mechanistic hypotheses (does intervention X cause effect Y?). The outer loop steps back to ask: what do these results *mean*? What patterns emerge? What's the story? Research is open-ended — the two loops let you both optimize and discover.

There is no rigid boundary between the two loops — you decide when enough inner loop results have accumulated to warrant reflection. Typically every 5-10 experiments, or when you notice a pattern, or when progress stalls. The agent's judgment drives the rhythm.

### Research is Non-Linear

The two-loop structure is a rhythm, not a railroad. At any point during research you can and should:

- **Return to literature** when results surprise you, assumptions break, or you need context for a new direction — always save what you find to `literature/`
- **Brainstorm new ideas** using `brainstorming-research-ideas` or `creative-thinking-for-research` when you're stuck or when results open unexpected questions
- **Pivot the question entirely** if experiments reveal the original question was wrong or less interesting than what you found

This is normal. Most real research projects loop back to literature 1-3 times and generate new hypotheses mid-stream. Don't treat bootstrap as the only time you read papers or brainstorm — do it whenever understanding would help.

## Bootstrap: Literature and Hypotheses

Before entering the loops, understand the landscape. Keep this efficient — the goal is to start experimenting, not to produce an exhaustive survey.

1. **Search literature** for the research question. Use multiple sources — never stop at one:
   - **Exa MCP** (`web_search_exa`) if available — best for broad discovery and finding relevant papers quickly
   - **Semantic Scholar** — best for ML/AI papers, citation graphs, and specific paper lookup. See `ml-paper-writing` skill's `references/citation-workflow.md` for complete API code examples
   - **arXiv / alphaXiv** — best for recent preprints and open-access papers
   - **CrossRef / DOI lookup** — best for DOI lookup and BibTeX retrieval
   - Keep searching until you have good coverage. If one source comes up empty, try another with different keywords

   **Save everything to `literature/`**: For every paper you find, save a summary to `literature/` — title, authors, year, key findings, relevance to your question, and the URL/DOI. Create one file per paper and a running `literature/survey.md` with all summaries. This is your reference library — you and future sessions will need it throughout the project.

2. **Identify gaps** from the literature
   - What's been tried? What hasn't? Where do existing methods break?
   - What do Discussion sections flag as future work?

3. **Form initial hypotheses** — invoke research ideation skills
   - `brainstorming-research-ideas` for structured diverge-converge workflow
   - `creative-thinking-for-research` for deeper cognitive frameworks
   - Each hypothesis must be testable with a clear prediction

4. **Define the evaluation**
   - Set the proxy metric and baseline before running experiments
   - The metric should be computable quickly (minutes, not hours)
   - Lock evaluation criteria upfront to prevent unconscious metric gaming

5. **Record** in `research/state.yaml`, log the bootstrap in `research/research-log.md`

## The Inner Loop

Rapid iteration with clear measurable outcomes. Two flavors:

- **Optimization**: make a metric go up/down (val_loss, accuracy, throughput). Think Karpathy's autoresearch.
- **Discovery**: test mechanistic hypotheses about why something works. The metric is a measurement (does grokking happen faster? does entropy increase before forgetting?), not just a target to optimize.

```
1.  Pick the highest-priority untested hypothesis
2.  Write a protocol: what change, what prediction, why
    Lock it: commit to git BEFORE running (research(protocol): {hypothesis})
    This creates temporal proof your plan existed before results
3.  Run the experiment (invoke the relevant domain skill)
4.  Sanity check before trusting results:
    - Did training converge? No NaN/Inf?
    - Does baseline reproduce expected performance?
    - Data loading correct? (spot-check a few samples)
5.  Measure the proxy metric
6.  Record structured outputs in `experiments/results/<experiment-id>/`, with matching notes in `experiments/logs/`
    If this hypothesis has become a long-lived branch, also maintain `experiments/<hypothesis-slug>/` for branch-local protocol, code, results, and analysis
    Label clearly: CONFIRMATORY (in your protocol) vs EXPLORATORY (discovered during execution)
7.  If positive: keep, note WHY it worked
8.  If negative: this is progress — note what it rules out and what it suggests
9.  Update `research/state.yaml`
10. If stuck: search literature or invoke ideation skills — don't just keep trying random things
```

Keep the research moving. Even if something fails, find a path forward: debug, adjust, simplify, or pivot. The point is steady progress, not blind persistence.

### Route to Domain Skills

When you need domain-specific execution, search the skills library:

| Research Activity | Relevant Skills |
|---|---|
| Research direction and synthesis | `idea-evaluator`, `brainstorming-research-ideas`, `creative-thinking-for-research`, `ara-rigor-reviewer`, `ara-research-manager` |
| Diffusion and image generation | `stable-diffusion-image-generation` |
| Fine-tuning and adaptation | `peft-fine-tuning`, `huggingface-accelerate` |
| Interpretability analysis | `transformer-lens-interpretability`, `sparse-autoencoder-training`, `pyvene-interventions`, `nnsight-remote-interpretability` |
| Evaluation and experiment tracking | `evaluating-llms-harness`, `weights-and-biases`, `tensorboard`, `experiment-tracking-swanlab` |
| Research writing and figures | `ml-paper-writing`, `figure-designer`, `academic-plotting` |

Read the relevant SKILL.md before starting — it has workflows, common issues, and code examples. See [references/skill-routing.md](references/skill-routing.md) for a complete guide.

### Track the Experiment Trajectory

Maintain a running record of measurable outcomes across experiments:

```json
{
  "experiment_id": "run_014",
  "hypothesis": "H3",
  "metric_value": 0.847,
  "baseline": 0.812,
  "delta": "+0.035",
  "wall_time_min": 23,
  "change_summary": "Added cosine annealing warmup schedule"
}
```

This trajectory produces the optimization plot (like Karpathy's progress chart) — include it in progress reports. Humans love seeing the upward curve.

## The Outer Loop

Step back from individual experiments. Synthesize.

```
1. Review all results since last reflection
2. Cluster by type: what kinds of changes worked? Which didn't?
3. Ask WHY — identify the mechanism behind successes and failures
4. Update `research/findings.md` with current understanding
5. Search literature if results were surprising or assumptions need revisiting
6. Generate new hypotheses if warranted
7. Decide direction (see criteria below)
8. Update `research/state.yaml` with new direction
9. Log the reflection in `research/research-log.md`
10. If there's something meaningful and the user would benefit from it, generate a progress presentation
```

### Deciding Direction

Don't just pick randomly — use these criteria:

**DEEPEN** — a supported result raises follow-up questions
- Does the effect hold under different conditions? What's the mechanism?
- Action: generate sub-hypotheses (H1.1, H1.2) → back to inner loop

**BROADEN** — current results are solid, but adjacent questions are untested
- New questions emerged. The current contribution is clear but more is possible.
- Action: generate new root hypotheses → back to inner loop

**PIVOT** — results invalidate key assumptions or something more interesting appeared
- A core assumption was wrong, or an unexpected finding is more promising than the original question.
- Action: return to literature with new questions → re-bootstrap

**CONCLUDE** — sufficient evidence for a contribution
- At least one hypothesis is strongly supported (or a coherent set of negative results)
- Key ablations completed, error analysis done
- `research/findings.md` reads like a paper backbone — a human could write the abstract from it
- No critical open questions that would change the story

Note: coherent negative results are a valid contribution. "X does NOT work because Y" is publishable if the reasoning is rigorous.

### `research/findings.md` Is Your Project Memory

This file serves two purposes: it's the research narrative for humans AND your accumulated knowledge base as an agent. Read it at the start of every session, /loop tick, or heartbeat to remember what you've learned.

After every outer loop, update it to answer:

- What do we know so far? (Current Understanding)
- What patterns explain our results? (Patterns and Insights)
- What specific things did we learn not to repeat? (Lessons and Constraints)
- What remains open? (Open Questions)

The "Lessons and Constraints" section is especially important — it captures specific actionable learnings like "weight decay > 0.1 diverges at this scale" or "baseline only reproduces with batch_size=64." This prevents the agent from repeating failed approaches across sessions.

**Quality test**: After 30 inner loop experiments, a human should be able to read `research/findings.md` and write a paper abstract from it. If they can't, the outer loop isn't synthesizing; it's just logging.

## Agent Continuity (Optional)

Continuous loop execution is optional in this repository. Use it only when the user explicitly wants unattended autonomous operation.

### Claude Code

If the user explicitly requests autonomous continuation, you can run:

```
/loop 20m Continue autoresearch. Read research/state.yaml and research/findings.md. Re-read the autoresearch SKILL.md occasionally to stay aligned. Step back and reflect holistically: is the research making real progress? Are you deepening understanding or just running experiments? If stalling, pivot or search literature for new ideas. Keep making research progress. Update research/findings.md, research/research-log.md, and research/state.yaml when there is new progress. When useful, prepare a report in to_human/. Only when the research is truly complete should you invoke the ml-paper-writing skill to write the paper.
```

This fires every 20 minutes regardless of what's happening. It's a rhythm for unattended work, not a research phase boundary. If your previous work isn't done, just continue it.

### OpenClaw

If the user explicitly requests unattended autonomous continuation, you can set up a 20-minute cron job in the current session.

Use the `cron.add` tool to create a recurring job bound to this chat session:

```json
{
  "name": "autoresearch-loop",
  "schedule": { "kind": "every", "everyMs": 1200000 },
  "sessionTarget": "current",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Continue autoresearch. Read research/state.yaml and research/findings.md. Re-read the autoresearch SKILL.md occasionally to stay aligned. Step back and reflect holistically: is the research making real progress? Are you deepening understanding or just running experiments? If stalling, pivot or search literature for new ideas. Keep making research progress. Update research/findings.md, research/research-log.md, and research/state.yaml when there is new progress. When useful, prepare a report in to_human/. Only when the research is truly complete should you invoke the ml-paper-writing skill to write the paper."
  }
}
```

Key details:
- `sessionTarget: "current"` binds the cron to this chat session so it maintains conversation context across ticks
- `everyMs: 1200000` = 20 minutes
- After creation, verify with `cron.list` that the job exists and is enabled
- If the cron fires while you're mid-experiment, just continue — the tick is a nudge, not a restart

### What the Loop Does

The `/loop` and cron job are purely **wall-clock rhythm**. They are completely separate from your research loops (inner/outer). On each tick:

1. Read `research/state.yaml` and `research/findings.md` — remember where you are
2. Check if anything is broken (failed experiments, stalled training, errors)
3. If on track → keep working on whatever you were doing
4. If stuck or something's wrong → step back, diagnose, fix, then continue
5. Never idle. Always be making progress.

## Progress Reporting

When you have something meaningful to share, create a research presentation — not just a status dashboard, but a compelling story.

**When to report** (your judgment):
- After an outer loop that found a significant pattern
- When the optimization trajectory shows clear progress (include the plot!)
- After a pivot in direction
- Before requesting human input on a decision
- When concluding

**What to include** (adapt to what's compelling):
- The research question and why it matters
- Key results with visualizations (plots, metric tables)
- The optimization trajectory chart (metric over experiments)
- What was tried and why (selective, not exhaustive)
- Current understanding (the findings narrative)
- What's planned next

For Claude Code: generate HTML and `open` it. If HTML fails to open or render, convert to PDF as fallback (use `weasyprint`, `playwright pdf`, or `wkhtmltopdf`). For OpenClaw: generate PDF directly.

See [references/progress-reporting.md](references/progress-reporting.md) for template scaffolding and the optimization plot approach. Use the template as a starting point — be creative with what you show.

## Git Protocol

Commit at natural research milestones:

| When | Message Pattern |
|---|---|
| Workspace initialized | `research(init): {project} — {question}` |
| Experiment protocol locked | `research(protocol): {hypothesis}` |
| Significant results | `research(results): {hypothesis} — {outcome}` |
| Outer loop direction change | `research(reflect): {direction} — {reason}` |
| Paper draft complete | `research(paper): {title}` |

**Hard rule**: Protocol commits MUST precede result commits. Never combine them. The git history is your lightweight pre-registration — it proves what you planned before you saw results. Don't commit after every experiment — commit when there's meaningful progress.

## Concluding: Paper Writing

When the outer loop decides to CONCLUDE:

1. Ensure `research/findings.md` has a clear, well-supported narrative
2. Study 2-3 top related papers to learn their format, style, and section structure
3. Invoke the `ml-paper-writing` skill to draft and refine the paper
4. Feed it the accumulated literature, experimental results, and findings
5. Follow its citation verification workflow — never hallucinate references
6. Generate a final comprehensive research presentation

Proceed autonomously through the writing process. If the ml-paper-writing skill suggests human collaboration points, adapt and keep going — produce the best draft you can. The human will review and provide feedback.

## Research Discipline

Principles to enforce continuously — not tied to any specific phase:

- **Lock before you run**: Commit your experiment protocol to git before executing. This proves your plan existed before you saw results. Never combine protocol + results in one commit.
- **Confirmatory vs exploratory**: Results matching your locked protocol are confirmatory. Everything else is exploratory — interesting but requiring more skepticism.
- **Negative results are progress**: A refuted hypothesis tells you something. Log what it rules out and what it suggests. Don't treat it as failure.
- **Sanity check before analysis**: Verify training converged, baselines reproduce, and data is correct before trusting your primary metric.
- **Return to literature when confused**: Don't guess — search. If results surprise you or assumptions break, go find papers. Use Exa MCP for discovery, Semantic Scholar for specific ML/AI paper lookup, arXiv for preprints.
- **Never stop**: Don't wait for human approval on routine decisions. If a skill or tool suggests collaboration, adapt and keep going. Find the best path forward autonomously. The human will see your progress reports and can redirect if needed.
- **Use whatever compute is available**: Adapt to the user's environment — local GPU, cluster job submission, cloud instances, or just CPU. If no GPU is available, use CPU and adjust experiment scale accordingly. Don't block on compute availability.

## Quality Standards

**Good agent behavior:**
- Hypotheses have mechanistic reasoning ("X because Y, predicting Z"), not just "try X"
- `research/findings.md` builds a coherent narrative, not a flat list of results
- Negative results are recorded with what they rule out
- The agent updates its model when experiments contradict expectations
- Progress reports tell a research story with compelling visualizations

**Bad agent behavior:**
- Pure hyperparameter sweeps without interpretation
- `research/findings.md` is just experiment logs copy-pasted
- Agent never revisits its assumptions after failures
- Optimizing metrics without understanding why changes work

## When to Use vs Alternatives

**Use autoresearch when:**
- You have a research question explorable through experiments
- There's a measurable proxy metric for inner loop optimization
- The real contribution requires synthesis beyond the metric
- You want continuous autonomous research operation

**Use individual domain skills instead when:**
- You have a specific one-off task (train a model, run eval, write a paper)
- No iterative experimentation needed

## Common Issues

**Inner loop stalls (no metric improvement)**
Run an outer loop. Is the metric the right one? Is the search space exhausted? Consider broadening or pivoting. Search literature for new approaches.

**Stuck and not making progress**
Don't keep trying random changes. Step back: search literature for related work, invoke ideation skills, or run an outer loop reflection. Being stuck means you need new information or a new perspective, not more experiments.

**Results contradict baseline expectations**
Investigate, don't ignore. Return to literature — your protocol might have an error, the published baseline may be wrong, or conditions differ. Update `research/findings.md` with what you learn.

**Agent loses context between ticks**
Ensure `research/state.yaml` and `research/findings.md` are updated after every action. These files are your memory across sessions.

**Can't find relevant papers**
Try multiple approaches in order: Exa MCP for broad search, Semantic Scholar for specific ML/AI paper lookup (`pip install semanticscholar`), arXiv for preprints (`pip install arxiv`). Check `ml-paper-writing` skill's `references/citation-workflow.md` for complete API code. Note: Google Scholar has no official API — use Semantic Scholar instead for programmatic search.

**No GPU available**
Use CPU and scale experiments down. Many research tasks (analysis, interpretability, small model training) run fine on CPU. Adjust experiment design to fit available compute rather than blocking.

**Experiments take longer than /loop interval**
Normal. On the next tick, check if it finished. If not, keep waiting or do something else useful (update notes, search papers). Adjust interval if needed.

**Not sure when to conclude**
Three questions: Do you have a strongly supported finding? Can you explain why it works? Would `research/findings.md` make a convincing paper abstract? If yes to all: conclude.
